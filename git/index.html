<pre>
# This is not a replacement for the git book (https://git-scm.com/book),
# but it should be much more succinct.

# chapter 0: terms, overview of internals
commit: a final change to the code
they have at least an author, date, and message.
the files changed, date, and author are all hashed to determine the tree-ish that identifies it.
the tree-ish is a SHA-1 hash

tree-ish (hash-ish, SHA)
e.g. : HEAD, origin/master, master, HEAD~5, HEAD^^, abc123def^^^, myremote/somebranch

branches: convention: default branch is "master". it is not special


# chapter 1: intro to git workflow
tracked, staged, committed
# staging will save files as well, so if you make additional changes, they won't be committed unless you first stage them again.

clone, pull (fetch, merge)
add, commit, push
init -- do not init inside of a git repository unless you know what you're doing

use SSH when interacting with github

remotes are just directories. most of the time they are accessed over http or ssh, but they can be on a local disk too.

checkout

# chapter 2: real git workflow
branch, rebase, fetch, reset, tracking branches
blame, log (logg)
push --force

stash

diff

rm --cached

# chapter 3: other topics
.gitignore, .gitmodules

gitignores are useful for ignoring temporary files made my editors (*.swp for Vim), compiled artificats like object files or executables, or filesystem objects (e.g. .DS_STORE for OSX).
They are useful for ignoring secrets files that contain private information.

interactive rebase (rebase -i)

bisect

signing, secondary messages

git revert

EDITOR

PS1

tagging

# examples:
revert file to how it was in an older commit:
git checkout OLD_COMMIT file
git add file
git commit


# bonus: commands I use 
* git commit --amend -C HEAD # amend and take message of amended commit
* git checkout -p (--patch)  # patch checkout (choose hunks to use/discard)
